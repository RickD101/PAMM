# PAMM: A Plant/Asset Maintenance Manager

PAMM is a web based application designed to incorporate the functionality of traditional maintenance management software. In my personal experience, software such as this can be quite outdated and legacy based. This leads to useage issues both remotely and on newer systems. I have also found the overall structure of maintanence management software can be convoluted and unintuitive. This app aims to address these issues and create an accessible and simple solution for industrial maintenance management.

A working deployment of the app can be viewed [here](https://pamm.herokuapp.com/).

## Technologies and approach taken

The app is built upon a custom scripted Node.js backend utilising an Express server with a MongoDB database. The basic structure of the backend can be seen in the models and relationships defined below:
